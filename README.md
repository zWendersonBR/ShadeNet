ShadeNet Cipher: Secure TCP/IP Communication (C# / .NET)ShadeNet Cipher is a command-line application built in C# (.NET) for demonstrating and studying asynchronous TCP/IP sockets. It features a Server (ShadeNetServer) that can handle multiple connections and a Client (ShadeNetClient) for connecting and engaging in basic console-based chat.🚀 PrerequisitesTo compile and run this application, you must have the .NET SDK installed. This project targets .NET 8.0.💻 Installation Guide for Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)Follow these steps in your terminal to install the latest .NET 8 SDK on Debian/Ubuntu systems:Install Required Dependencies:sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl
Download and Install the Microsoft Package Signing Key:sudo apt install -y ca-certificates gnupg
sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/microsoft.gpg
curl -fsSL [https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc](https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc) | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/microsoft.asc > /dev/null
Add the Microsoft Package Repository:echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-arch) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/microsoft.gpg] [https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/$(lsb_release](https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/$(lsb_release) -rs)/prod $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
Install the .NET 8.0 SDK:sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0
Verification: Run dotnet --version to confirm installation (should return 8.0.x).🛠️ Installation Guide for WindowsDownload and run the official installer for the .NET SDK 8.0 from the Microsoft website.🚀 Local Execution GuideYou will need two terminal/command prompt windows to run the Server and the Client simultaneously.1. Start the Server (ShadeNetServer)The Server must be started first.StepCommand (Linux, PowerShell, CMD)1. Navigate to the Server directorycd ShadeNetCipher/ShadeNetServer2. Run the Server applicationdotnet runWhen prompted, enter the Listening IP and the Port.For Local Use: Enter 127.0.0.1 (or 0.0.0.0) and your desired port, e.g., 5000.2. Start the Client (ShadeNetClient)Open a second terminal window to run the Client.StepCommand (Linux, PowerShell, CMD)1. Navigate to the Client directorycd ShadeNetCipher/ShadeNetClient2. Run the Client applicationdotnet runThe Client will ask for the Server IP, Port, and a Nickname.For Local Use: Use the same IP and Port defined in the Server setup (e.g., IP: 127.0.0.1, Port: 5000).🌐 Remote Connection and SharingTo allow external users to connect to your server over the internet, several network configurations are mandatory.🔑 A. Connection ParametersServer Listening IP: When starting the Server, always use 0.0.0.0 as the Listening IP to bind to all available network interfaces.Client Connection IP: Remote Clients must use the Public IP Address (External IP) of the machine running the Server. You can usually find this by searching "What is my IP" on Google.Port: The Client must connect using the exact Port number configured on the Server.🛡️ B. Network Configuration (Firewall & Router)1. Operating System Firewall (Windows/Linux):The chosen port (e.g., 5000) must be open in your OS firewall.Windows: Create an inbound rule to allow TCP traffic on the port for the Server executable.Linux (UFW Example): Allow the port using a utility like UFW:sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp
2. Port Forwarding (NAT Configuration):If the Server is behind a home or office router, you MUST configure Port Forwarding.Action: Log into your router's administration panel (usually via a web browser).Rule: Create a rule to redirect all incoming TCP traffic on the chosen external port (e.g., 5000) to the Internal (Local) IP Address of the machine running the Server.⚠️ CGNAT Warning (Crucial for Remote Hosting)If your Internet Service Provider (ISP) uses Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), your Public IP is shared with other customers, and you will not be able to successfully configure Port Forwarding.Solution: To host a public server, you must have a truly dedicated Public IP. This often requires:Contacting your ISP to request a dedicated IP (may incur costs).Using a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or Cloud Service with a fixed, publicly accessible IP address.
